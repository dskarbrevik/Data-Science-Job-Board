Data Scientist,N/A,"San Jose, CA","WHO WE AREBold Metrics Inc. (BMI) has created a suite of AI technologies that allows brands to accurately predict customer body measurements and relate them to garment specifications. Using our cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, retailers and brands are ditching conventional sizing solutions and leveraging our technology to reduce returns and increase conversions. Ultimately, our goal is to revolutionize the apparel industry by leveraging this data to unlock body-relative apparel design.

Historically, apparel sizes have been generated in the absence of customer-driven body data. This has lead to a worldwide apparel waste problem caused by a high rate of returns coupled with a bad consumer experience around fit and sizing, often amplified online. Along with garment sizing optimizations, the downstream experience becomes more customer-driven, leading to a significant reduction in returns and happier customers.

We are a venture-backed well funded company ($3.77M raised to-date) with year-over-year growth of 350%. Bold Metrics works with some of the worlds largest brands, retailers and clothing manufacturers in the US, Europe and Asia, and has offices in Austin, TX and San Francisco, CA.

Data Scientist,Mystery Science,"San Francisco, CA","Data ScientistWe’re looking for an experienced Data Scientist to join our Growth Team. As our first Data Scientist, you will have the opportunity to shape the team, shape our tooling, and play a key role in decisions impacting our product strategy. From the beginning of the company, we've been systematic in our testing and analysis of product experiences, and we have grown quickly thanks to a highly optimized viral referral loop. But up until now, analysis and experimentation has been handled by our growth engineers / every member of our growth team. We are ready to build out our data science capabilities. We are headquartered in San Francisco and this position is based in our office.
Do you have experience working as a Data Scientist on a disciplined growth team?
Are you someone who has a deep understanding of the core principles of statistics and can explain them to a layman?
Are you adept enough as an engineer that you can hop into code, fix some instrumentation, and migrate a couple database columns in order to enable the analysis you want to do?
This is an opportunity to help fix science education for the next generation. In this role you’ll report to our Director of Growth, Huey Kwik. You’ll work closely with him, our whole product team, and our CEO—we are very collaborative in our product experimenting and analysis. Our team’s experience with growth and data comes from Facebook and Palantir, with many years of experience optimizing conversion funnels. Help us create more problem solvers by bringing a better science education to 25 million kids.

What is Mystery Science?

Mystery Science has created the fastest growing science curriculum in the U.S. We’re already used by teachers in more than 20% of elementary schools in the country. We have an early product with a lot of future plans, yet our sales have already taken off. In an industry that is plagued by long sales cycle and high barriers to entry, we’ve sold thousands schools without a single sales person. We’re backed by a great group of investors including Y Combinator, Learn Capital, and Reach Capital.

If you’re looking for the basics:
$4M in funding from leading education investors
Competitive salary
Equity in a high-growth company
401K, health care, vacation
Customers who love us
…but the real perks of working at Mystery Science are the quality of the people on your team and the problem we’re solving. This is what bring us to work every day.

On your first day at Mystery Science, you’ll meet 20 people who are passionate about science, children, and education, and who each love their respective crafts. You can meet our team here: http://mysteryscience.com/team.

We are collecting every question children ask about the world and building out the ultimate knowledge base for kids. Our mission is to help children stay curious as they grow up. Our first product is a tool for teachers to use in the classroom. It contains a full science curriculum that makes it easy for elementary teachers to re-create scientific discoveries in the class. Thanks to support from our teachers, we’re now collecting kids’ questions and building a platform to answer every question. We’re preparing to build a visual Wikipedia for kids, enabling children to explore any question they have.

We’re on a mission to accelerate human progress by creating more problem solvers in the next generation. We’re working on the most important infrastructure problem in the world today: our ability to solve problems. Richard Feynman explains the problem well. To paraphrase him: our modern lives are made possible by our knowledge of science and technology, yet remarkably few people have a scientific perspective on the world. At Mystery Science, we have developed a unique way to pass on knowledge to the next generation and develop children’s ability to think.

If you’re an experienced Data Scientist with deep experience helping grow products and want to be an early member of our Growth Team, let’s talk.

Data Scientist,Alorica,"Irvine, CA","Who we want

We are looking for people passionate about using data and analysis to make things happen. We want people who believe strongly that within mountains of customer service data, are insights that can improve the lives of others. We want people who love finding compelling patterns within big data, finding the story buried in the data, and communicating insights and opportunities. We seek people who want to join a team of analysts and data scientists in developing data-discovery tools and creative approaches to interpretation of data, to move both Alorica, its clients, and its customers.

What you will do

Alorica data scientists work in small 2-3 person teams on a range of strategic projects, to inform executive decision-making, to support internal operations, and to improve client performance. We measure and model the performances of call center sites and the clients they support, along with the interactions between agents and customers. We have big data that no one else has, and you will use your technical skills to analyze large data sets to understand customer behavior. Beyond technical skill, you will need to exercise business judgement in prioritizing your efforts, and the communications skill to interact with non-technical colleagues.

While transactional data may be structured and within a data warehouse, nearly every project will require that you merge external structured or semi-structured data or create your own data lake. Sometimes, you will spend a significant amount of time trying to figure out what data exist, who can help you get it, and how to transform it to become more useful. The data you work with may be incomplete, or require you to cleanse or process it, and develop a scholarship over its limitations.

Like traditional business analysts, you will use query skills and statistical packages such as SAS and R. To build models and algorithms, you may need operations research skills. Some projects will require machine learning techniques, such as random forest decision trees, topic modeling, similarity indexes, and deep data mining. The best tools and techniques to use change project-by-project, and if there is one certainty, it is that you will need to teach yourself new skills along the way.

Qualifications

What you need

A master’s degree or Ph.D. in quantitative discipline: statistics, mathematics, computer science, physical sciences, economics, or operations research is preferred. We will consider advanced degrees from other programs, provided candidates have significant technical experience and skills. 2+ years industry experience working with large amounts of demographics or customer service data with SQL, R, or SAS; experience with unstructured data, Hadoop, pig, hive a plus. 2+ years programming experience, such as python, java, shell scripting and working with large datasets, especially observational data Data engineering, administration, architecture, ETL, AWS/MSAzure a plus Experience building predictive models or algorithms, and implementing them in a production environment is preferred Background in the fundamentals of machine learning and statistics; recommendation systems, random forests, natural language processing, topic modeling, similarity indexes, etc. The ability to explain complex technical material to nontechnical or executive audiences Ability to translate business objectives in actionable analysesCandidates must be authorized to work in the United States.

Forward-Deployed Data Scientist,Heap,"San Francisco, CA","We're looking for the founding member of our client-facing data science team.

We have access to an unprecedented amount of data due to how Heap works. Our approach to analytics means that we have a complete picture of everything our customers’ customers do within their product. We’ve barely scratched the surface of what we can do with that data.

As a forward-deployed data scientist, you’ll work with our largest clients on strategic projects to uncover insights about their users. The work you do will push the boundaries of what can be accomplished with Heap, will feed directly back into our product roadmap, and serve as the source of content to define Heap as a thought-leader in this space. You will have a deep impact on our customers’ strategy, and you’ll get to work with customers across a breadth of roles, industries, and business models.

Your responsibilities:

Be the data expert our customers don’t have access to. Learn what challenges our clients are facing, and solve their problems using your unique skillset and vantage point. Maybe a customer has a massive churn problem, and you build a statistical model to predict churn before it happens.

Think strategically about businesses. What questions are our customers not asking that they should be?

Become a Heap and SQL power user. The main platforms you’ll use are Heap and our customers’ data warehouses. You’re also not afraid to get your hands dirty with Python, R, JavaScript, or whatever else is required to solve a problem.

Publish your work. You’ll be among the first in the world to notice macro trends affecting various types of online businesses, and you’ll write reports about your findings.

You'll need to have:

Experience in a consultative, customer facing role (management consulting, account management, etc)

Multiple years of data analysis or software engineering experience.

Strong project management skills

Strong writing skills

A willingness to travel to clients as needed

Heap has raised $40M in funding from NEA, Y Combinator, Menlo Ventures, SVAngel, Sam Altman, Garry Tan, Alexis Ohanian, Harj Taggar, Ram Shriram, and others.

We work in SF, can cover relocation costs, and offer plenty of awesome benefits. We'd love to hear from you!

Be the SME. Develop modern data architectural approaches to meet key business objectives and provide end to end data solutions
You might spend a few weeks with a new client on a deep technical review or a complete organizational review, helping them to understand the potential that data brings to solve their most pressing problems.
On other projects, you might be acting as the architect, leading the design of technical solutions, or perhaps overseeing a program inception to build a new product.
It could be much more about getting stuck into a delivery project where you're equally happy coding and tech leading the team to implement the solution.
Whatever your role, the team always look to draw on your experience when things get tough and you often handle the difficult client conversations allowing the team to continue delivering without undue pressure.
You have great relationships with our new business team and work collaboratively to support pre-sales, meet prospective clients and ultimately influence and shape our portfolio of work.

Positive Outlook


I have been working at Veeva Systems full-time



Pros
Excellent interview process. I communicated with 4 different Veeva employees over the entire process. Loved the candidate exercise. While it was a lot of work and took a week to complete, it is a great way to become familiar with the product Veeva sells. If you like the candidate exercise, you will like the job if hired.




Cons
Need a 3.0 cumulative GPA to get the job. Potentially weeding out some other great employees. One thing I have learned, especially for consultant positions, is that college grades do not matter much. It is more communication and understanding the product. 10% of what you learn in college is actually applicable to the real world.




Advice to Management
Overall great interview process. Keep doing the candidate exercise. It is a great way for the candidates to learn about he Veeva product.

They can put a good employee down and kill their motivation.  Unfortunately those people get promoted.  I am not sure what HR is doing/thinking about?!Show More

Were tackling the problems that drive global business.

We're applying ML and deep learning to tackle some of the most enduring challenges in business: pricing optimization, demand projection, logistic & supply chain optimization, manufacturing operations, and many many more. For example: How do you transform operations for a client in a 150-year-old energy-intensive industry to support their journey toward becoming a LEED-certified global leader in energy efficiency? How do you quantify the cognitive bias that has shaped past pricing decisions to support ongoing sales effort optimization?


There is an exciting journey ahead, and were going to have fun along the way.

Were kind of nerdy We geek out about new technology. We love music. Were into soccer. We dance through life (sometimes literally). Were foodies. Essentiallywe love noodling on new ideas and our love of learning extends beyond our fields of study. And we like to share that.

As a Google Research Scientist, you will continue to be an active contributor to the wider research community by collaborating with academic researchers and by publishing papers.

Researchers on the Google Brain team have the freedom to set their research agenda and to engage as much or as little as they wish with existing products, choosing between doing more basic, methodological research or more applied research as necessary to produce the most compelling results. Because many of the advances we develop today may take years to become useful, the team as a whole maintains a portfolio of projects across this spectrum. It is our philosophy that making substantive progress on hard applications can help drive and sharpen the research questions we study, and in turn scientific breakthroughs can spawn entirely new applications.

The Google Brain team’s research focuses on methods that can learn multiple layers of rich, non-linear feature extractors and can scale to large amounts of data. Much of our work is best understood as part of the deep learning subfield of machine learning, but we are interested in any methods capable of efficient and effective feature learning that get good results on challenging problems.

Data Scientist - AI / ML,"Balbix, Inc.","San Jose, CA","WHO WE ARE

At Balbix we build a breach risk dashboard for cybersecurity. Think of us as preventative healthcare for enterprise networks whose vitals we continuously discover, monitor and quantify. Specifically, we model the risk carried by hundreds of attack vectors (e.g. likelihood of breach from phishing), contextualize them to physical assets in the enterprise (e.g. firewalls, laptops, etc.), and prioritize these assets by their relative impact of breach (e.g. active directory servers are more important than display devices). The outcome is a clickable, searchable, and human readable risk dashboard that is relevant, engaging and easy on the eyes. 
DATA SCIENCE AT BALBIX
Data Science at Balbix is embedded into engineering and product functions.

In each area, we draw boldly from the latest in machine learning research but are also unafraid to limit ourselves to expert systems or linear regression if the situation demands it. 
We stretch ourselves to be generalists, caring as much about storytelling with data, as about bleeding edge algorithms, or scalable model training and deployment. Going forward, we are keen to build a data science culture with equal parts emphasis on knowing our raw data, grokking security first principles, caring about customer needs, explaining our model predictions, deploying them at scale, communicating our work across the company, and adapting the latest advances from arXiv and NIPS.

We look out for each other, enjoy each others company, and keep an open channel of communication about all things data and non-data.

Airtime is looking for a combined data scientist+engineer reporting to the head of data science who will own building and improving our real-time machine learning and recommendation systems.

About Airtime

Today, online means alone immersed in microblogs and success theater. We're changing that. We are charting the course for the next era of the Internet: live, shared experiences. We're building a new way to use the Internet together.

Thats why were pioneering a new kind of social experience, one designed for togetherness. At its core, Airtime is a social platform for doing whatever together. Gather with your people to explore the Internet: group video, listen to music, chat, watch stuff, send pictures, GIFs, and more.

Go watch the app marketing video on https://air.me/ then check out the app in person.

Our company was founded a few years ago by Sean Parker and Shawn Fanning and is backed by Kleiner Perkins, Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures, Founders Fund, and a host of other amazing partners.

What Youll Do

Work alongside the product, engineering and data science teams to build scalable real-time machine learning and recommendation systems for friends to make, rooms to join, media to watch together, and contacts to invite to Airtime
Transform a stream of 100k user events per minute into real time recommendation updates for millions of users.
Work with the backend and data science team to build a system like Ubers Michelangelo (https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/) that allows for efficient exploration of different algorithms and approaches.
Work with multiple data sources including Kinesis, SQS, Aurora, MongoDB

Who You Are

Motivated to do and learn what is necessary to accomplish your goals: Youll bring your existing experience to bear but you will need to learn about our product space, engineering environment, and novel ways to meaningfully improve the quality of our recommendation systems.
Excited by both data engineering and machine learning challenges. It will be necessary to feel comfortable with the entire data science pipeline and engineering environment. Youll solve theoretical problems and write code at scale.
Comfortable with, and better yet excited by, product exploration. We are continually changing and improving our product to delight users.
Have a strong engineering and analytics mindset. You dont need any particular degree just a provable track record of delivering.
Works well with a team. Not a cowgirl or cowboy. Teams that encourage and foster debate in a healthy way provably deliver the best work.

Positive Outlook


I have been working at Veeva Systems full-time



Pros
Excellent interview process. I communicated with 4 different Veeva employees over the entire process. Loved the candidate exercise. While it was a lot of work and took a week to complete, it is a great way to become familiar with the product Veeva sells. If you like the candidate exercise, you will like the job if hired.




Cons
Need a 3.0 cumulative GPA to get the job. Potentially weeding out some other great employees. One thing I have learned, especially for consultant positions, is that college grades do not matter much. It is more communication and understanding the product. 10% of what you learn in college is actually applicable to the real world.




Advice to Management
Overall great interview process. Keep doing the candidate exercise. It is a great way for the candidates to learn about he Veeva product.

"Data Science Manager, Location Services",Uber,"San Francisco, CA","About Uber

We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.

For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.

And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.

About the Role

The location services team creates the technologies that allow users to specify pickup and destination locations in Uber’s map. For example, riders can use map search to search for a hotel, a type of restaurant, or an address. We also provide a set of destination options to riders, which are created by a destination prediction engine. Drivers who want to relocate to an area of higher demand can specify a neighborhood to which they want to navigate. We leverage predictive modeling, machine learning, search, and optimization methods to create a magical experience with these products.



You’ll be the data science technical lead or manager for the team, working closely with software engineers and product managers to create and execute the direction of the product development. This includes crafting a machine learning or data science solution to achieve a business goal, guiding the team’s direction through data-driven insights and algorithmic thinking, and providing team members with feedback on their work. The role can also include full management responsibilities, such as growing the team, if you have management experience.



The team currently has two data scientists, and we’re looking to grow to 4+ over the next year. There’s also a sister team that creates the points of interest data (such as hotel or restaurant data with address information) leveraged by the location services; if you have extensive management experience then the role can be expanded to manage data science for both teams.

What You’ll Do

Provide analysis using mathematical modeling tools to improve business processes and decisions.Define creative solutions to business problems using advanced mathematical algorithms.Embed with engineering and partner closely with operations, business, and infrastructure groups.Communicate with senior management and cross-functional teams.Build and validate prototypes to demonstrate the benefits from proposed changes to decision systems and operational processes.

What You’ll Need

M.S. or Ph.D. degree in Statistics, Computer Science, Operations Research, Economics, or other quantitative discipline strongly preferred.Data analytics and experimentation skills.Predictive modeling and machine learning/statistical modeling.Ability to drive clarity on the best modeling or analytic solution for a business objective.Experience driving research and development.Experience communicating with both technical and business people. Ability to speak at a level appropriate for the audience.Ability to develop statistical analysis and machine learning software in a language like Python or Java.

About the Team

The Maps team builds the systems and services that provide the geospatial backbone of Uber's functionality. Our group's systems mediate our users' digital connection to their physical world through traffic modeling, travel time estimation, geospatial search, hotspot computation, and map display and navigation.

Sr. Data Scientist,20th Century Fox,"Los Angeles, CA","The Senior Data Scientist will be a member for true[X]'s Data Science team. This team is responsible for researching and analyzing data sets, and creating the statistical and machine learning models that power some of our most advanced advertiser technology.

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:

Changing the established guidelines of an industry, especially one as rooted as digital advertising, isn't an easy or quick effort, but we believe it's the right thing to do and we want to be the ones to do it. We're looking for hungry people who are passionate about redefining the digital video and media world, from how consumers experience it to how content creators fund it.

We work hard at true[X], and we believe in fostering an open, collaborative, motivating, creative culture for our team; put simply, our employees love to come to work. We have all the perks you can expect from a startup environment, including a sunlit rooftop patio, corn hole and ping pong, and a stocked pantry and fridge.

The true[X] technology team is a bit of an anomaly in the tech world: Once people join us, they tend to stick around. Our leadership has been a part of this company for 10+ years (since the beginning), and our turnover is exceptionally low.

You can ask individual members their thoughts, but this dedication generally comes down to two factors. First, the people: We hire smart, driven, accountable, and friendly individuals. We all appreciate and are proud of the culture we've created here, and it's in no small part due to our high hiring standards. Second (and this point cannot be understated): There is a endless supply of engaging engineering work to be done. Our engineers are constantly expanding their knowledge and experience, whether it be exploring a new language on a hackday, learning the internals of various cloud platforms, or leveraging new tools to work with our ""Big (and growing!) Data"". Boredom doesn't exist here.

Our leadership takes pride in fostering a sustainable software development cadence. No artificial deadlines. No guilting our team into staying late. And no micromanagement. We use the best tools to get the job done, end of story. We communicate via Slack (mostly emojis and gifs, really). We like testing. We have an aversion to meetings. You get the hardware you prefer (within reason) to make you as productive as possible. We want you to be happy, and stay a valuable team member for a long time to come.

As a Data Scientist, you will be joining one of the most innovative teams at true[X]. As an AdTech company, data is our lifeblood, and there's a lot of it. Every data scientist wants to get his/her hands on large and interesting data sets, and we can deliver that and more. We do cutting edge ad optimization, and that's the tip of the iceberg. If you've wanted to join a team where your work can really have an effect, you've found the right place.

RESPONSIBILITIES:

Leverage ""Big Data"" tools (Spark/Hadoop Ecosystem) and cloud services to build ETL pipelines for the massive and complex data collected on true[X]'s proprietary ad platform and by third-party vendors. Ensure data quality throughout all stages of acquisition and processing, including data sourcing, cleansing, normalization, transformation, mapping, etc. Develop statistical methods and data mining algorithms to solve difficult, non-routine analysis problems and provide insights to various internal and external stakeholders.Research and implement novel machine learning and deep learning methods. Deliver a machine learning project from beginning to end, including validating needs, specifying the requirements, defining an approach, aggregating and exploring data, building and validating models, deploying completed models, and using the results to deliver business impact to true[X].Write production-level codes (Python/Scala/C++) to implement machine learning models at scale. Work with QA/platform/software engineers to test and deploy the models to cloud-hosting ad serves. Monitor the model performance and efficiency in real time, diagnose and resolve potential production issues, and improve as needed.Interact cross-functionally with a wide range of people and teams. Collaborate with colleagues from engineering, business and art backgrounds. Present proposals and results in a clear manner backed by data and coupled with actionable conclusions.Provide direction and guidance to more junior members of team on all aspects of data science from business context to technical coaching.

REQUIREMENTS:

Advanced degree in machine learning, optimization, or relevant fieldsIn-depth understanding of modern machine learning models and their mathematical underpinningMinimum 5 years of working experience in the areas of machine learning, predictive modeling and data miningProven track record of customizing machine learning solutions to business problems in a cross functional teamKnowledge of common data structures and ability to write efficient code in at least one programing language (Python, Scala, Java, or C++)Experience with cloud services (AWS/Google Cloud/Microsoft Azure)Excellent verbal and written communication and data/model presentation skills, including an ability to effectively communicate with both business and technical teams

Senior Data Engineer: Massive Graph Processing,LiveRamp,"San Francisco, CA","Help us process a trillion edge graph as quickly and efficiently as possible. Were LiveRamp Identity Engineering, and we maintain a massive graph that connects together the different identifiers for consumers (e.g., anonymized email addresses and phone numbers) and the devices they use online.

The engineering systems weve developed are constantly ingesting new edges from thousands of different sources and finding numerous types of relevant paths to power LiveRamps suite of core products.

You Will:

Get to work on projects such as:


Pregel Path Computer: This system finds relevant graph paths using the pregel graph computation framework as implemented in Apache Giraph. There are challenges in running Giraph at the scale of our graph and were constantly looking to refine our Pregel algorithms.

Edge Ingestion and Partitioning Framework: We could never process all trillion edges at once and luckily we dont have to. Instead we process subgraphs that contain specific types of edges. Our edge ingestion and partitioning framework manages different Hadoop datastores for different types of edges and automates the ingestion of new edge data. It leverages LiveRamps Seek MSJ framework to efficiently incorporate new data into existing edge stores.
Path Computation as a Service: We provide a service to other LiveRamp engineering teams for finding specific types of paths within our massive graph. It handles 20,000 requests a day and this is possible due to its use of caching and intelligently batching similar request together.

Your Team:



We take pride in operating as a high performance team, while maintaining kindness and humility.
We find feedback to be important in helping us grow as individuals and as a team; were always looking for chances to share positive and constructive feedback.
We develop in Java and use MapReduce, Giraph, and Spark. Were open to new technologies and languages if they help us better solve a problem.
We currently use a 79,800 core Hadoop cluster with 90 PB of disk space and 256 TB of RAM (shared across all of LiveRamp data engineering) to power our systems. Were also exploring moving everything to AWS.

About You:



Have 3+ years of experience writing and deploying production code.
Have a passion for building large scale, distributed systems and are comfortable writing high performance code.
You love mentoring junior engineers, and deploying best practices.
