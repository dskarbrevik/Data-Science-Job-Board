Data Leadership,Riot Games,"Los Angeles, CA","Riot Games was established in 2006 by entrepreneurial gamers who believe that player-focused game development can result in great games. In 2009, Riot released its debut title League of Legends to critical and player acclaim. As the most played PC game in the world, over 100 million play every month. Players form the foundation of our community and its for them that we continue to evolve and improve the League of Legends experience.

Were looking for humble but ambitious, razor-sharp professionals who can teach us a thing or two. We promise to return the favor. Like us, you take play seriously; youre passionate about games. We embrace those who see things differently, arent afraid to experiment, and who have a healthy disregard for constraints.

That's where you come in.

Do you craft, cultivate, and champion your team's vision for data-powered products? Build and grow a team of high-performing data developers? Share your world-class technical knowledge, design sense, and development methods? Establish the processes and infrastructure that make orgs run not walk? If you said ""hell yeah!"" to a bunch of those, you're ready to be a Data Lead at Riot.

The Data Discipline improves player experience through world class data processing and machine learning. We strive to power all of Riot's products with data to learn from and deliver value to our players. We're looking for leaders who can support data developers working on League of Legends and get us ready for whatever comes next.You are:



Educated: you've got an advanced degree in Economics, Statistics, Computer Science, Applied Math, Management Information Systems, or a related discipline; a PhD or double dose of Mastery (MSc, MBA) will move you closer to the top of the list
Multiclassed: the first few levels of your career were probably spent as a specialist, working primarily on predictive analytics, machine learning, or data pipelines; since then you've branched out to other technical domains, or you've picked up team-oriented roles like scrum master, tech lead, or product owner
A proven leader: you bring 5+ years of experience in the field-- post-doc years count, grad school years don't; you have successfully led and mentored data developers (scientists, engineers, architects) to deliver big impact on cross-discipline teams
A builder: you've been a key contributor (e.g. architect, lead, manager) on a team that built/ran a data warehouse or a production-quality analytics or machine learning pipeline
A clear communicator: you know how to explain highlevel concepts in simple terms using the most appropriate medium, be it hallway chat, email, dashboard, or data viz; you'll also be able to effectively facilitate discussions with teammates and stakeholders
Focused on delivery: you've got a track record of building and shipping innovative products, setting vision and strategy for a team, and identifying opportunities for new products and collaborations
Player-focused: as a gamer yourself, you know the importance of listening to player needs, especially the implicit needs that can only be uncovered by analyzing and understanding player data

You will:

Manage performance, support growth: our Focus on Talent and Teams means we hold our leaders accountable for the performance and growth of the people they support; you're flexible in how you enable others' success and you have a track record of making your team better through strong relationships, servant leadership, and consistently high standards
Build and refine people systems: you recognize that the right structure and process unlock collaboration, improve efficiency, and help people prioritize effectively; you also know that too much focus on these mechanics feels bad; you'll always be experimenting and tuning to keep the team's output, impact, and morale high
Combine data and domain knowledge to deal with ambiguity: data is an important input to decision making and prioritization, but it's not the only input; youll help other leaders and teammates improve their decisions through thoughtful data work combined with critical thinking and player empathy
Be a great collaborator: to get your team's contribution out to players or used by Rioters, you'll rely on your cross-discipline relationships to enable and deliver the discipline's best work; you educate Rioters about discipline capabilities, advocate for amplifying product impact through the inclusion of data-powered features, and mentor your people in how to excel on cross functional teams
Ship the right ""it"": you're accountable for setting your team up to build the right products and tools around Riot's data, which means helping them find the best opportunities and making sure they deliver their best work; you know the stakes are high whether we're shipping to players or supporting Rioters, and so you insist that your team's work reflects excellence in their craft
Build team vision and direction: you want every Rioter on your team to be able to independently make good decisions that balance product priorities, discipline capabilities, and player needs to maximize Data's unique contribution to the dev cycle
To that end, you help the team establish a clear vision that lets them reason about how Data work connects to broader Riot efforts; you aid each individual in using this vision to identify opportunities for professional growth and increased impact

Dont forget to include a resume and cover letter. We receive a lot of applications, but well notice a fun, well-written intro that shows us you take play seriously.
