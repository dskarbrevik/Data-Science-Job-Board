"Upwork is the world’s largest marketplace for remote work where we distributed over $1.5B between clients and freelancers last year alone. Because we exist, people make a living off of our platform every single day including logging over 1.6M hours of work in our hourly business alone.

Critical to the Upwork experience is the romance of matching clients, people who need work done, with freelancers, people who can do work. Bringing two people together who are both trying to get work done is the core problem that the VP of Data Science and Search Engineering will own and represents the central nervous system of the company.

The reason is that Upwork is a two-sided marketplace - perhaps the largest of its kind. Freelancers can look for work by posting jobs and clients can search for freelancers who post their profile. Despite the challenges of such a mechanic, we have over 10+ years of data on how people get work done, and we’re using it in meaningful ways.

We’ve also crafted a diverse team of graduates and former professors from top universities around the world in fields ranging from computer science and electrical engineering to economics and statistics.

The final missing piece is you.

You need not have previously carried a VP title but you have led teams to work on Internet-scale matching problems from some elite institutions like eBay, Amazon, Apple, Google, Netflix, Facebook, and Alibaba. We are looking for someone to be proficient in the latest data science ideas while possessing the precision of an exemplary engineering leader. Beyond being an exceptional data scientist and engineering leader, you will need to have a strong product sense and be a persistent beacon of innovation for Upwork that produces world-inspiring research and inventions.

You've done your job when you and your team consistently manufacture seemingly impossible outcomes that have extraordinary implications not just for Upwork, but for the millions of people who use the platform.

A matching system perfectly tuned could in theory guarantee income for qualified freelancers who join the site that is highly skilled and qualified or work so well that a client can find a freelancer they would be excited to work with in a single session. We believe these moonshots are within reach and at our scale, the implications could have profound consequences for labor itself.

If you and the team you’re on are successful, you will change the company and the world.

In this role, you will:

Lead a team of over 50 engineersOperate a high uptime engineering operation for a system that is a critical revenue generator for the companyGenerate ideas that inspire your team, your colleagues, and the companyDeliver company-changing models and run them reliably on production

Deep knowledge of machine learning, information retrieval, data mining, statistics, NLP or related fieldSolid architecture skills that enable you to validate the decisions your engineering leaders makeSuperior public speaking and interpersonal skills to make difficult concepts easy to understand and accessible15+ years of job experience and at least 5 years of experience leading and developing teams of 30 or more

Come change how the world works.

At Upwork you’ll help shape the future of work. From our offices in San Francisco, Mountain View and Chicago, together we’re creating exciting new opportunities for a world of professionals. You’ll be part of a vibrant culture built on shared values: Inspire a boundless future of work, Put our community first, Have a bias towards action, and Build amazing teams.

"Data ScientistWe’re looking for an experienced Data Scientist to join our Growth Team. As our first Data Scientist, you will have the opportunity to shape the team, shape our tooling, and play a key role in decisions impacting our product strategy. From the beginning of the company, we've been systematic in our testing and analysis of product experiences, and we have grown quickly thanks to a highly optimized viral referral loop. But up until now, analysis and experimentation has been handled by our growth engineers / every member of our growth team. We are ready to build out our data science capabilities. We are headquartered in San Francisco and this position is based in our office.
Do you have experience working as a Data Scientist on a disciplined growth team?
Are you someone who has a deep understanding of the core principles of statistics and can explain them to a layman?
Are you adept enough as an engineer that you can hop into code, fix some instrumentation, and migrate a couple database columns in order to enable the analysis you want to do?
This is an opportunity to help fix science education for the next generation. In this role you’ll report to our Director of Growth, Huey Kwik. You’ll work closely with him, our whole product team, and our CEO—we are very collaborative in our product experimenting and analysis. Our team’s experience with growth and data comes from Facebook and Palantir, with many years of experience optimizing conversion funnels. Help us create more problem solvers by bringing a better science education to 25 million kids.

What is Mystery Science?

Mystery Science has created the fastest growing science curriculum in the U.S. We’re already used by teachers in more than 20% of elementary schools in the country. We have an early product with a lot of future plans, yet our sales have already taken off. In an industry that is plagued by long sales cycle and high barriers to entry, we’ve sold thousands schools without a single sales person. We’re backed by a great group of investors including Y Combinator, Learn Capital, and Reach Capital.

If you’re looking for the basics:
$4M in funding from leading education investors
Competitive salary
Equity in a high-growth company
401K, health care, vacation
Customers who love us
…but the real perks of working at Mystery Science are the quality of the people on your team and the problem we’re solving. This is what bring us to work every day.

On your first day at Mystery Science, you’ll meet 20 people who are passionate about science, children, and education, and who each love their respective crafts. You can meet our team here: http://mysteryscience.com/team.

We are collecting every question children ask about the world and building out the ultimate knowledge base for kids. Our mission is to help children stay curious as they grow up. Our first product is a tool for teachers to use in the classroom. It contains a full science curriculum that makes it easy for elementary teachers to re-create scientific discoveries in the class. Thanks to support from our teachers, we’re now collecting kids’ questions and building a platform to answer every question. We’re preparing to build a visual Wikipedia for kids, enabling children to explore any question they have.

We’re on a mission to accelerate human progress by creating more problem solvers in the next generation. We’re working on the most important infrastructure problem in the world today: our ability to solve problems. Richard Feynman explains the problem well. To paraphrase him: our modern lives are made possible by our knowledge of science and technology, yet remarkably few people have a scientific perspective on the world. At Mystery Science, we have developed a unique way to pass on knowledge to the next generation and develop children’s ability to think.

If you’re an experienced Data Scientist with deep experience helping grow products and want to be an early member of our Growth Team, let’s talk.

About The I School

UC Berkeley’s newest school, the School of Information (I School), was created in 1994 to address one of society’s most compelling challenges: the need to organize and make sense of the abundance of information that we can now collect, store, and share without regard for cost or distance. The way we organize, represent, govern, and make sense of this information will shape our ability to achieve public as well as private goals.

The I School educates professionals and scholars to understand the problems and possibilities of information, to develop models of information practice, and to design useful and usable information applications, services, and solutions. This requires insights from diverse fields. Our faculty includes scholars and professionals with deep expertise in information and computer science, social sciences, management, law, design, and policy, as well as related fields.

We offer professional master’s degrees and an academic doctoral degree. Our on-campus master’s program (MIMS) trains students for careers as information professionals and emphasizes small classes and project-based learning. Our MICS program prepares cybersecurity leaders with the technical skills and contextual knowledge necessary to develop solutions for complex cybersecurity challenges. Our web-based master’s program (MIDS) is the first and only degree available completely online to train data science professionals. Our Ph.D. program equips scholars to contribute to knowledge and to the policies that influence the organization, use, and sharing of information.

Our graduates work at well-known Bay Area companies that include Apple, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Twitter, and LinkedIn, as well as at nonprofits like Kaiser Permanente and established businesses like Wells Fargo and Chevron. Many of our graduates take advantage of the opportunity to get in on the ground floor to create or work for start-ups.

"About Uber Were changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now were a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether its a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it. For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer. And thats just what were doing today. Were thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, were in for the long haul. Were reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.

 About the Role The location services team creates the technologies that allow users to specify pickup and destination locations in Ubers map. For example, riders can use map search to search for a hotel, a type of restaurant, or an address. We also provide a set of destination options to riders, which are created by a destination prediction engine. Drivers who want to relocate to an area of higher demand can specify a neighborhood to which they want to navigate. We leverage predictive modeling, machine learning, search, and optimization methods to create a magical experience with these products. Youll be the data science technical lead or manager for the team, working closely with software engineers and product managers to create and execute the direction of the product development. This includes crafting a machine learning or data science solution to achieve a business goal, guiding the teams direction through data-driven insights and algorithmic thinking, and providing team members with feedback on their work. The role can also include full management responsibilities, such as growing the team, if you have management experience. The team currently has two data scientists, and were looking to grow to 4+ over the next year. Theres also a sister team that creates the points of interest data (such as hotel or restaurant data with address information) leveraged by the location services; if you have extensive management experience then the role can be expanded to manage data science for both teams. 

What Youll DoProvide analysis using mathematical modeling tools to improve business processes and decisions.Define creative solutions to business problems using advanced mathematical algorithms.Embed with engineering and partner closely with operations, business, and infrastructure groups.Communicate with senior management and cross-functional teams.Build and validate prototypes to demonstrate the benefits from proposed changes to decision systems and operational processes. What Youll NeedM.S. or Ph.D. degree in Statistics, Computer Science, Operations Research, Economics, or other quantitative discipline strongly preferred.Data analytics and experimentation skills.Predictive modeling and machine learning/statistical modeling.Ability to drive clarity on the best modeling or analytic solution for a business objective.Experience driving research and development.Experience communicating with both technical and business people. Ability to speak at a level appropriate for the audience.Ability to develop statistical analysis and machine learning software in a language like Python or Java. About the Team The Maps team builds the systems and services that provide the geospatial backbone of Uber's functionality. Our group's systems mediate our users' digital connection to their physical world through traffic modeling, travel time estimation, geospatial search, hotspot computation, and map display and navigation.

My path to being a Technical Recruiter started when I was a Sales Rep selling Telecom services back in 1996. One of my calls was to a small recruiting firm in Foster City, which ended up recruiting me and my life has been recruiting focused since.

While the mechanics of a job search are very basic, its the intricate details that can muddle things up. That's where my experience comes in. One thing I will never do is to send your resume to a client without finding out if you are interested in the opportunity.

I am also a firm believer that if I treat my candidates and clients with respect and professionalism, they will be relationships for life. This is important, as the key to being a successful recruiter is the ability to have candidates feel comfortable about giving their friends as referrals.
